Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)
Conceptual Understanding:
 
Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design? Yes
 
 
 
MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
 
Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications? Yes
 
 
 
Web API: (Yes/No) 
 
Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API? No
 
 
 

Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:
 
 
Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
 
 
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

 Answer: 
   The code is organized into different layers, making it clear what each part of the application does. When you need to make changes, the clear structure helps you find and modify the right part of the code without affecting everything else.
 
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
 
 Answer:
  Yes, Having a hard time understanding the Onion Architecture Ive always encounter many errors and hard to understand how this kind of programming works.
 

MVC:
 
 
Components: (1-3 keywords each)
 
 
Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
 
Answer:
  Model - Manages data and business logic. Handles data processing and rules.
  View - Displays data to the user. Represents the user interface.
  Controller - Acts as a bridge between Model and View. Handles user input and updates the Model.
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
 
Answer
 Yes, sometimes its complicated but I understand the basic from it.
 

Web API:
 
 
Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
 
 
Answer:
  Traditional MVC applications are designed to build full web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern. They incorporate Models to manage data and business logic, Views to render HTML pages, and Controllers to handle user input and interactions. The primary purpose of these applications is to generate dynamic web pages that users can interact with directly through a web browser.
  In contrast, Web APIs focus on providing data services rather than full web applications. They utilize Models to manage data and Controllers to handle requests, but they do not use Views. Instead of rendering HTML, Web APIs return data in formats like JSON or XML. These APIs are meant to be consumed by other applications or services, enabling programmatic access to data and functionality without a user interface.

 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)
 
 Answer:
   Yes, Having understanding on those two I think the traditional have way more complicated than Web APIs for example, like there are many changes you must have to do to run or to fix the error for the traditional MVC
